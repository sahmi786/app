## EMAIL 1: Kam Khan - Secure Trust Bank

**To:** kamkhan@securetrustbank.co.uk  
**Subject:** Quick question about Secure Trust Bank's infrastructure strategy

Hi Kam,

Hope you are well. I came across your profile and noticed you're heading up IT infrastructure at Secure Trust Bank - always good to connect with fellow Midlands-based infrastructure leaders.

With the changes at VMware post-Broadcom, I imagine banking infrastructure decisions are getting more complex. We're a Nutanix partner working with several UK banks on migration assessments, and I thought it might be worth a conversation.

For organisations similar to Secure Trust Bank, we're typically seeing 40-60% TCO improvements while maintaining the resilience and compliance standards banking demands.

Would a brief call be useful to compare notes?

Best regards,

## EMAIL 2: Patrick Casteleijn - Wavenet

**To:** patrick.casteleijn@wavenet.co.uk  
**Subject:** Infrastructure & cybersecurity - thoughts from a fellow Midlands tech company

Hi Patrick,

Hope you are well. As someone leading both infrastructure and cybersecurity at Wavenet, you'll know better than most how the two are increasingly intertwined.

Given Wavenet's growth and your position as a leading managed services provider, I imagine you're constantly evaluating infrastructure options - both for internal use and potentially for client offerings.

We're a Nutanix partner helping UK organisations navigate the post-VMware landscape. The hyperconverged approach particularly suits security-conscious environments where simplicity reduces attack surface.

Worth a quick conversation to see if there's any alignment?

## EMAIL 3: Neil Jones - Fisher German LLP

**To:** neil.jones@fishergerman.co.uk  
**Subject:** Infrastructure for growing property firms - quick thought

Hi Neil,

Hope you are well. I noticed you're overseeing IT infrastructure and service operations at Fisher German - quite a breadth of responsibility across a firm with such geographical reach.

Property and land management firms often have unique infrastructure needs: multiple offices, remote workers, and increasingly data-heavy operations. The VMware pricing changes are making many reconsider their approach.

We're a Nutanix partner working with professional services firms on infrastructure modernisation. The simplified management model often appeals to teams juggling infrastructure with service delivery.

Would 15 minutes be useful to discuss what you're seeing?

Best regards,

## EMAIL 4: Steve Peak - Gateley Legal

**To:** steve.peak@gateleyplc.com  
**Subject:** Legal sector infrastructure - a fellow Birmingham perspective

Hi Steve,

Hope you are well. Always good to connect with fellow Birmingham-based IT leaders - Gateley's growth from regional firm to AIM-listed national practice is impressive.

Legal services have demanding infrastructure requirements: data security, availability, and increasingly, the ability to support flexible working. The VMware licensing changes post-Broadcom are adding cost pressure to an already complex equation.

We're a Nutanix partner helping professional services firms evaluate their options. For firms like Gateley, the combination of enterprise reliability and predictable costs often makes sense.

Worth a brief conversation?

## EMAIL 5: Daryl Burrows - Samworth Brothers

**To:** daryl.burrows@samworthbrothers.co.uk  
**Subject:** Infrastructure for UK food manufacturing - quick question

Hi Daryl,

Hope you are well. Samworth Brothers' scale is impressive - £2.1B revenue and operations spanning multiple sites requires serious infrastructure to keep everything running smoothly.

Food manufacturing presents unique challenges: 24/7 operations, OT/IT convergence, supply chain integration, and increasingly stringent compliance requirements. The VMware pricing changes are making many manufacturers reconsider their virtualisation strategy.

We're a Nutanix partner working with UK manufacturers on infrastructure modernisation. The hyperconverged approach suits multi-site operations particularly well.

Would a conversation be useful to explore whether this is relevant to Samworth Brothers?
