With hashtags + engagement CTAs

## TWEET 1 (Main hook)
Just set up Clawdbot in 10 minutes.

It's the best AI agent I've ever used. Not even close.

Here's how I did it (and why I'm genuinely excited):

First - what is it?

Clawdbot is an AI agent that actually DOES things:

• Reads and writes files
• Runs shell commands
• Searches the web
• Sends emails
• Controls your browser
• Connects to Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord

What would YOU automate first? 👇

Setup was stupidly simple.

Step 1: Install it

npm install -g clawdbot

That's it. One command.

Step 2: Run the onboarding

It walks you through:
• API key setup
• Workspace folder
• Channel connections

Felt like talking to a helpful friend, not reading docs.

What's the best onboarding you've experienced? 👇

Step 3: Connect your channels

I linked Telegram in 2 minutes.

Now I message my AI agent like I message my mates.

"Research this"
"Send an email to..."
"Download images of..."

It just... does it.

Which messaging app would you connect? 👇

## TWEET 6
The moment it clicked for me:

I asked it to search for BMW Alpina images, download them, and send them to my Telegram.

2 minutes later - 11 high-res images in my DMs.

No copying. No manual downloads. Just results.

What task would save YOU the most time? 👇

What makes it different from ChatGPT?

ChatGPT talks.
Clawdbot acts.

It has access to your filesystem, terminal, browser, and messaging apps.

It doesn't tell you how - it does it for you.

Agree or disagree? Let me know 👇

## TWEET 8
The "soul" system is brilliant.

You create a SOUL.md file that defines who your agent is.

Mine knows:
• My name
• My company context
• My preferences

It's not generic AI. It's MY AI.

Would you customise yours? What personality? 👇

## TWEET 9
First 24 hours I've:

• Written and sent business proposals
• Created social media campaigns
• Downloaded and organised images
• Set up automated reminders
• Research + summaries

All through Telegram messages.

What's the craziest thing you'd ask an AI agent to do? 👇

## TWEET 10
The learning curve? Almost zero.

If you can chat, you can use Clawdbot.

But if you're technical, the depth is insane:
• Custom skills
• Cron jobs
• Multi-agent sessions
• Browser automation

It scales with you.

Beginners - would you try it? 👇

## TWEET 11 (Closer)
I've tried dozens of AI tools.

Most are toys. Good for demos, useless for work.

Clawdbot is the first that feels like a genuine multiplier.

10 minutes to setup. Unlimited leverage after.

## ALT: Single Viral Tweet Version

Just set up Clawdbot in 10 minutes.

Asked it to research, write a proposal, and email my team. Done in 3 mins.

Then asked it to find BMW Alpina images and send to my Telegram. 11 HD images delivered.

Best AI agent I've ever used. It DOES things, not just talks.
