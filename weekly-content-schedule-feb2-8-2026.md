## 📊 LINKEDIN CONTENT CALENDAR

### MONDAY - VMware Migration Reality Check
**Hook:** "VMware migrations taking longer than expected? You're not alone."

**Post:** The reality of leaving VMware is hitting home for many enterprises. Recent industry reports show migrations are more complex than anticipated - especially for deeply integrated VCF environments.

At Nubera, we're seeing three common blockers:
- NSX security policy complexity
- Legacy application dependencies  
- Internal change management resistance

The solution isn't rushing. It's having a clear roadmap and experienced partners.

Nutanix Move 6.0 now handles NSX security migrations - a game-changer for VCF customers.

Planning your exit strategy? Let's talk.

### WEDNESDAY - Kubernetes Made Simple
**Hook:** "Kubernetes shouldn't require a PhD to deploy."

**Post:** Most enterprises want containers. Few want the complexity that comes with traditional K8s deployments.

That's where Nutanix Kubernetes Platform (NKP) changes the game:
- One-click cluster provisioning
- Integrated storage and networking
- Enterprise-grade security built in
- Works across any cloud

Your developers focus on code. Your ops team sleeps at night.

Ready to simplify your container strategy?

### FRIDAY - AI Infrastructure Reality
**Hook:** "AI projects fail not because of bad models - but bad infrastructure."

**Post:** Everyone's talking about AI. Few are talking about what it takes to actually run it.

The truth: AI workloads are infrastructure-hungry beasts. They need:
- GPU acceleration at scale
- Fast storage (NVMe minimum)
- Flexible compute allocation
- Cost predictability

Nutanix GPT-in-a-Box brings enterprise AI to your data center without the cloud bill shock.

Your data stays yours. Your AI runs locally. Your CFO stays happy.
