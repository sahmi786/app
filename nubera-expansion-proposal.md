# Nubera European Expansion Proposal
## Netherlands & Spain Office Establishment

**Prepared for:** Metsi Board of Directors  
**Date:** 27 January 2026  
**Prepared by:** Nubera Strategy Team

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the strategic rationale, value proposition, and implementation plan for establishing Nubera offices in the Netherlands and Spain. The timing is exceptional: the VMware market disruption following Broadcom's acquisition has created a once-in-a-decade migration opportunity, and both markets are actively seeking alternatives.

---

## 1. Market Opportunity

### The VMware Exodus

Since Broadcom's $69 billion acquisition of VMware in late 2023, enterprise customers face:

- **Price increases of 85-500%** under forced subscription bundling
- **Minimum 72-core licensing requirements** (effective 2025), penalising smaller deployments
- **Elimination of perpetual licenses**, forcing unwanted transitions
- **Partner program restructuring** requiring €800K+ annual commitments

**Market projections:**
- **Gartner:** 35% of VMware workloads will migrate to alternatives by 2028
- **Forrester:** 20% of enterprise VMware customers began migration planning in 2024
- **Nutanix** is specifically cited as a primary destination for migrating workloads

### Netherlands: Ground Zero for VMware Resistance

The Netherlands represents the most strategically valuable entry point in Europe:

**Legal Precedent (June 2025):** A Dutch court ruled that Broadcom must provide migration support to Rijkswaterstaat (Ministry of Infrastructure) for up to two years, establishing a "duty of care" framework. Key details:
- Rijkswaterstaat faced an 85% cost increase (€2.1M → €4M annually)
- Court imposed penalties of €250,000/day (up to €29M) for non-compliance
- This precedent **empowers other Dutch organisations** to demand migration support

**Why this matters for Nubera:**
- Dutch enterprises are actively seeking migration partners NOW
- The legal framework validates the urgency of migration projects
- Contract renewals throughout 2025-2026 create immediate pipeline
- Strong buyer-led resistance to Broadcom's tactics is "structured, public, and repeatable"

### Spain: Untapped Potential

Spain offers complementary advantages:
- Large enterprise market with significant VMware footprint
- Lower cost base for delivery operations
- Gateway to Latin American markets (language/cultural alignment)
- Growing data sovereignty requirements driving on-premises/hybrid demand
- Less saturated competitive landscape than Northern Europe

## 3. Impact Analysis

### Revenue Opportunity

**Conservative Year 1-3 Projections (per office):**

| Year | Netherlands | Spain | Combined |
|------|-------------|-------|----------|
| Y1 | £800K - £1.2M | £500K - £800K | £1.3M - £2M |
| Y2 | £1.5M - £2.2M | £1M - £1.5M | £2.5M - £3.7M |
| Y3 | £2.5M - £3.5M | £1.8M - £2.5M | £4.3M - £6M |

**Assumptions:**
- 4-6 migration projects per office in Y1, scaling to 12-15 by Y3
- Average project value £150K-£300K
- 30% of projects convert to managed services retainers
- Netherlands ramp faster due to immediate demand; Spain builds over time

### Strategic Impact

**Market Positioning:**
- First-mover advantage in VMware migration services in both markets
- Establishes Nubera/Metsi as European migration specialists
- Creates reference customers for broader European expansion

**Competitive Moat:**
- Deep Nutanix partnership differentiates from generalist integrators
- Migration expertise is time-sensitive; building it now creates barriers
- Local presence beats remote delivery for enterprise trust

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Geographic diversification beyond UK market
- Multiple revenue streams (project + managed services)
- Positions for post-VMware market (ongoing Nutanix services)

## 5. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Slower than expected sales cycle | Medium | High | Aggressive outbound marketing; target organisations with imminent renewals |
| Talent acquisition challenges | Medium | Medium | Offer relocation packages; remote-first flexibility; competitive compensation |
| Broadcom softens pricing | Low | High | Diversify into broader Nutanix services; VMware trust damage is lasting |
| Local competition | Medium | Medium | First-mover advantage; specialisation depth; Metsi brand backing |
| Economic downturn | Low | Medium | VMware migrations are cost-driven; downturn may accelerate urgency |

---

## 6. Success Metrics

**6-Month Milestones:**
- Offices operational in both markets
- 4+ active engagements combined
- £400K+ pipeline value

**12-Month Milestones:**
- 8-12 completed projects
- £1M+ recognised revenue
- 2+ managed services contracts
- Break-even trajectory visible

**24-Month Milestones:**
- £2.5M+ annual revenue run rate
- Self-sustaining operations (positive cash flow)
- 10+ reference customers
- Assessment for Phase 2 European expansion

---

## 7. Recommendation

**We recommend proceeding with establishment of both offices, prioritising the Netherlands for immediate launch given the exceptional market timing.**

The VMware migration wave is time-bound. Organisations making decisions in 2025-2026 will commit to platforms and partners for the next 5-10 years. Entering now captures this market; waiting means competing against entrenched players.

The Netherlands offers the strongest immediate opportunity due to the legal precedent and active buyer resistance. Spain provides geographic diversification and a platform for future Latin American expansion.
