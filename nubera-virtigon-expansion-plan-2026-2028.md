# KEY RISKS & CONSIDERATIONS

## Nubera Netherlands
1. **Market Entry Risk:** Weak existing reseller presence - need to build from scratch
2. **Longer Sales Cycles:** Enterprise Nutanix deals can be 6-12 months
3. **Competition:** Established competitors in NL market
4. **Mitigation:** Leverage Belgium reputation and existing Nutanix relationship

## Virtigon Spain
1. **Utilisation Risk:** New market may have inconsistent demand initially
2. **Contractor Dependency:** Contractors may leave for other opportunities
3. **Language/Culture:** Ensure contractors have local market knowledge
4. **Mitigation:** Start with Nutanix-referred projects to ensure pipeline

---

# RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Nubera NL:** Strong opportunity - larger market, proven model from Belgium. ROI looks excellent. Consider accelerating second hire if first shows early traction.

2. **Virtigon Spain:** More cautious - services margins are tighter. Consider starting with 1 contractor and adding second only after proving utilisation >60%.

3. **Review Points:**
   - Q3 2026: Review Sales Rep 1 pipeline before confirming Jan 2027 hire
   - Q4 2026: Review Contractor 1 utilisation before adding Contractor 2
