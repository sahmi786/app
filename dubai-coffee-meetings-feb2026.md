## SUGGESTED OUTREACH EMAIL

**Subject:** Coffee in Dubai? 9-12 Feb - quick infrastructure chat

Hi [Name],

Hope you are well. I'll be in Dubai 9-12 February and wondered if you'd have 20 minutes for a coffee?

I'm co-founder of Metsi, a Nutanix partner working with organisations across the UK and Middle East on infrastructure modernisation - particularly helping companies navigate the post-VMware landscape.

Given your role at [Company], I thought it might be interesting to exchange perspectives on where infrastructure is heading in the region.

No sales pitch - just a chance to connect and share insights. Happy to work around your schedule.

Best regards,
Ghufran Shah
Co-founder, Metsi
