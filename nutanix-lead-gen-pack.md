## D) OUTREACH TEMPLATES

### Cold email - VMware pain angle:
```
Subject: Quick question about your VMware renewal

Hi [Name],

With Broadcom's changes to VMware licensing, I'm curious - has [Company] started exploring alternatives, or are you planning to stay the course?

We've helped [similar company] reduce their virtualisation costs by 40% while actually improving performance. Happy to share how if useful.

Worth a 15-min call?

[Your name]
```

### LinkedIn connection request:
```
Hi [Name] - I work with infrastructure leaders navigating the post-Broadcom VMware landscape. Would love to connect and share some insights from recent migrations we've supported. No pitch, just genuine expertise sharing.
```
