2. **Target DIFC** - Dubai is booming (100+ hedge funds now), more accessible than London
3. **LinkedIn is key** - most finance hiring happens via LinkedIn and referrals
4. **Tailor each message** - reference specific firm/role when possible
5. **Follow up** - one polite follow-up after 5-7 days if no response
