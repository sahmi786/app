## EMAIL 1: Mark Watts - London Square

**To:** mark.watts@londonsquare.co.uk
**Subject:** Quick question about London Square's infrastructure

---

Hi Mark,

I noticed you joined London Square as Head of IT recently - congratulations on the new role.

With the company's growth following the Aldar acquisition, I imagine infrastructure scalability is on your radar. We've helped property development firms simplify their virtualisation stack while cutting costs by 30-40% through Nutanix.

Would a 15-minute call be useful to see if there's a fit?

If this isn't relevant right now, just let me know and I won't follow up.

Best regards,

## EMAIL 2: Andy Simmonds - The Office Group

**To:** andy.simmonds@theofficegroup.com
**Subject:** Multi-site infrastructure for flexible workspaces

---

Hi Andy,

Running IT across The Office Group's portfolio must come with unique challenges - multiple locations, consistent user experience, and keeping costs manageable.

We work with multi-site businesses to consolidate their virtualisation onto Nutanix - typically seeing 30-40% cost reduction with simpler operations. Particularly relevant with Broadcom's VMware pricing changes affecting many organisations right now.

Worth a quick conversation to see if it's relevant for TOG?

If not the right time, just say - I won't chase.

## EMAIL 3: Jon Cheyne - Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames

**To:** jon.cheyne@kingston.gov.uk
**Subject:** Nutanix for local government - G-Cloud approved

---

Hi Jon,

I'm reaching out because we work with several local authorities on their virtualisation infrastructure, and I thought Kingston might be evaluating options given Broadcom's VMware licensing changes.

We're a Nutanix partner on G-Cloud, so procurement is straightforward. We've helped councils reduce infrastructure costs while improving resilience - happy to share specifics if useful.

Would a brief call make sense, or is this already sorted for you?

## EMAIL 4: Caroline Noble - Mannok

**To:** caroline.noble@mannokbuild.com
**Subject:** Infrastructure for manufacturing - simpler than VMware

---

Hi Caroline,

Building materials manufacturing needs reliable infrastructure - ERP systems, supply chain, and increasingly OT/IT convergence.

With Broadcom's changes to VMware, many manufacturers are exploring Nutanix as a simpler, more cost-effective alternative. We've helped similar organisations reduce complexity while cutting virtualisation costs by 30-40%.

Is this something Mannok is looking at? Happy to share what we're seeing in the sector.

If not relevant, just let me know.

Best regards,

## EMAIL 5: Stuart Courcoux - ASSA ABLOY Opening Solutions

**To:** stuart.courcoux@assaabloy.com
**Subject:** Enterprise virtualisation - beyond VMware

---

Hi Stuart,

Leading IT for a 3,000+ employee operation like ASSA ABLOY Opening Solutions means balancing performance, cost, and operational simplicity.

With Broadcom's VMware changes driving many enterprises to re-evaluate, we've been helping organisations transition to Nutanix - typically achieving 30-40% cost savings with reduced operational overhead.

Would it be worth a conversation to see if this is relevant for your infrastructure roadmap?

No worries if the timing isn't right - just let me know.

Best regards,

## EMAIL 6: Neil Mowforth - Biosynth

**To:** neil.mowforth@biosynth.com
**Subject:** Validated infrastructure for life sciences

---

Hi Neil,

Your title mentions Infrastructure, Cloud, and Cyber - so I'll get straight to the point.

We work with pharma and life sciences companies on Nutanix implementations. The platform's simplicity and built-in resilience makes GxP validation more straightforward than traditional VMware environments - and typically costs 30-40% less.

Given Broadcom's licensing changes, is this something Biosynth is evaluating?

Happy to share specifics from similar deployments if useful. If not the right time, no problem - just say.

Best regards,

## EMAIL 7: Jonathan Cattle - Staysure Group

**To:** j.cattle@staysure.co.uk
**Subject:** Insurance infrastructure - simpler and more resilient

---

Hi Jonathan,

As CTO of Staysure, you're balancing performance, compliance, and cost - the usual insurance IT trifecta.

We've been helping insurers migrate from VMware to Nutanix, driven by Broadcom's pricing changes. The results: 30-40% cost reduction, simpler operations, and infrastructure that auditors actually understand.

Worth a quick conversation to see if it's relevant for Staysure?

If not the right time, just let me know and I won't follow up.

Best regards,

## EMAIL 8: James Thackrah - British International Investment

**To:** jthackrah@bii.co.uk
**Subject:** Infrastructure for development finance

---

Hi James,

Running IT Production at BII means reliability is non-negotiable - your systems support investment decisions that shape economies.

We work with financial services organisations on Nutanix infrastructure - simpler than VMware, typically 30-40% lower cost, and built for resilience. Particularly relevant now given Broadcom's licensing changes.

Would a brief conversation be useful to see if there's a fit?

If this isn't on your radar right now, no problem - just let me know.

## EMAIL 9: David Bowles - Portsmouth City Council

**To:** david.bowles@portsmouthcc.gov.uk
**Subject:** Nutanix for Portsmouth - G-Cloud ready

---

Hi David,

I'm reaching out because we support several local authorities with Nutanix infrastructure, and I wondered if Portsmouth is evaluating options given Broadcom's VMware changes.

We're on G-Cloud, so procurement is straightforward. Councils we work with typically see 30-40% cost savings versus VMware, with simpler day-to-day operations.

Would a quick call be useful, or is your virtualisation strategy already set?

Either way, just let me know.

## EMAIL 10: Adam Spencer - Anaplan

**To:** adam.spencer@anaplan.com
**Subject:** Infrastructure at scale - Kubernetes and beyond

---

Hi Adam,

As VP Infrastructure at Anaplan, you're operating at serious scale - 2,200 people, $592M revenue, and a platform millions depend on.

We specialise in Nutanix solutions, including NKP (Nutanix Kubernetes Platform) for organisations running cloud-native workloads alongside traditional VMs. Particularly relevant as Broadcom's VMware changes push many to re-evaluate their stack.

Would a conversation about what we're seeing in the SaaS infrastructure space be useful?

If not the right time, no problem at all.
