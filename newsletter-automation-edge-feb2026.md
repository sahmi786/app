🎯 THIS MONTH'S BIG IDEA

The VMware Migration Reality Check

Everyone's talking about VMware migrations. Few are talking about why so many fail.

After helping dozens of organisations navigate the post-Broadcom landscape, here's what I've learned: the technical migration is the easy part. The hard part is the organisational change that comes with it.

Nutanix recently reported "hundreds" of VMware customers migrating in Q1 FY2026 alone. But the stock dipped. Why? Migration complexity is taking longer than expected. Revenue is shifting to later quarters because these projects are bigger and messier than anticipated.

This isn't a Nutanix problem - it's an industry reality.

The three migration killers I see most often:

1. Underestimating the app dependency mapping - You don't know what you don't know until you start moving things
2. Skills gaps - Your VMware experts need time to become AHV experts
3. The "lift and shift" trap - Moving without optimising just relocates technical debt

The organisations succeeding are the ones treating this as a transformation, not a migration.

What's your experience been? Drop a comment - I'd love to hear your war stories.


🔧 AUTOMATION WINS

Win #1: The 8-Minute Kubernetes Cluster

One of our clients was spending 4+ hours manually provisioning development environments. With Nutanix Kubernetes Platform (NKP) and some GitOps magic, we got that down to 8 minutes - fully automated, consistent every time.

The secret? Treating infrastructure as code from day one, not as an afterthought.

Win #2: Self-Service Done Right

A financial services client wanted developers to provision their own test environments without involving ops. Sounds simple. Usually ends in chaos.

We built guardrails into CloudBolt that let developers get what they need in minutes while keeping governance tight. Result: 73% reduction in ops tickets, zero compliance incidents.

Win #3: The Observability Gap

"We have monitoring" - every organisation says this. Then you ask: "Can you tell me the cost per transaction for your top 10 applications?" Silence.

We helped a retail client connect their infrastructure metrics to business outcomes. Now they can actually answer that question. That's the difference between monitoring and observability.


☁️ INFRASTRUCTURE ROUNDUP

What happened this month:

📌 Cisco + Nutanix + Pure Storage Alliance - The big news. These three are now offering a joint VMware alternative. This is significant - it's the first time we've seen major players formally align against VCF. [Forbes, Jan 2026]

📌 Nutanix AOS 6.8 Validated - Fresh migration checklists are emerging for vSphere 7/8 to AHV. If you're planning a migration, the tooling is maturing fast.

📌 Broadcom's Bundling Backlash Continues - More organisations are pushing back on VCF-only licensing. The "VMware tax" conversation isn't going away.

My take: The ecosystem is finally rallying around real alternatives. Two years ago, VMware migrations felt risky. Today, there's a genuine competitive market. That's good for everyone - including VMware customers who stay.


🤖 AI CORNER

Tool of the Month: Claude for Infrastructure Docs

I've been using Claude (the AI you're indirectly hearing from) to help draft runbooks and documentation. The quality of first drafts has dramatically improved our documentation velocity.

But here's the insight: AI doesn't replace the engineer who knows the system. It amplifies them. The best results come from experienced practitioners using AI as a force multiplier, not from hoping AI will figure it out alone.

Trend to Watch: AIOps Getting Real

We're past the hype phase. The AIOps tools that survived are now genuinely useful for anomaly detection and root cause analysis. If you evaluated this space 2 years ago and dismissed it - worth another look.


🔮 TECH TRENDS TO WATCH

Here's what's on my radar for 2026:

1. Edge AI Goes Mainstream - AI chips in edge devices are enabling real-time decisions without cloud round-trips. Predictive maintenance, smart traffic, instant fraud detection - all happening at the edge. If your architecture is still cloud-only, you're already behind.

2. Kubernetes Becomes the AI Orchestrator - GPU-centric workloads are exploding, and K8s is evolving to handle them. Self-healing clusters, intelligent scheduling for expensive accelerator hardware - this is where the action is.

3. Multi-Cloud Stops Being Optional - It's no longer "should we go multi-cloud?" but "how do we manage it effectively?" The winners will be those with consistent tooling across providers.

4. FinOps Matures - Cloud cost management is finally getting serious. Expect more integration between infrastructure decisions and financial impact. The question "what does this deployment cost per transaction?" will become standard.

5. Platform Engineering Takes Centre Stage - Internal developer platforms are moving from "nice to have" to "competitive advantage." Reducing cognitive load on dev teams is the new productivity multiplier.

Which trend are you most focused on? I'd love to hear your priorities.


📚 WHAT I'M READING

"Team Topologies" by Matthew Skelton & Manuel Pais

Re-reading this one. As infrastructure becomes more software-defined, the way we organise teams matters more than ever. The concept of "cognitive load" in platform engineering is something every infrastructure leader should understand.

Key insight: Your platform team's job isn't to build features. It's to reduce the cognitive load on stream-aligned teams. Changes how you measure success.


💭 LEADERSHIP REFLECTION

"Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself."
- Rumi

After 14 years building Metsi, this hits different now.

Early in my career, I thought leadership was about having the answers. Now I know it's about asking better questions and creating space for others to find answers.

The best infrastructure transformations I've seen weren't led by the smartest technologist in the room. They were led by people humble enough to listen and brave enough to change their minds.

What's one thing you've changed your mind about recently?
