## EMAIL 1: Andy Samuel - Ardonagh Group

**To:** andy.samuel@ardonagh.com  
**Subject:** VMware costs rising? Ardonagh deserves better options

Hi Andy,

With Broadcom's acquisition of VMware driving licence costs up 300-500% across the industry, I imagine infrastructure planning at Ardonagh is getting more complex.

We're working with several UK insurers exploring Nutanix as an alternative - same enterprise reliability, predictable licensing, and no vendor lock-in. For a group your size (2,200+ employees across multiple brands), the savings can be substantial.

Would a 15-minute call be useful to share what we're seeing in the insurance sector?

## EMAIL 2: Matej Pfajfar - Monzo Bank

**To:** matejpfajfar@monzo.com  
**Subject:** Hybrid infrastructure for challenger banks - quick question

Hi Matej,

Monzo's cloud-native approach is well known, but I'm curious - are there workloads where data sovereignty or regulatory requirements push you toward on-prem or hybrid?

We're helping several UK fintechs navigate the VMware pricing changes with Nutanix - particularly for compliance-sensitive workloads that need to stay closer to home.

If hybrid infrastructure is on your radar, I'd welcome 15 minutes to share what's working for similar organisations.

## EMAIL 3: Dougie Kennedy - Aegon UK

**To:** dougie.kennedy@aegon.co.uk  
**Subject:** Aegon UK - VMware alternatives worth exploring?

Hi Dougie,

The post-Broadcom VMware landscape is forcing a lot of financial services CTOs to re-evaluate their virtualisation strategy. With Aegon's compliance requirements and long-term planning horizons, I imagine predictable infrastructure costs matter.

We're a Nutanix partner helping UK insurers and pensions providers assess their options - whether that's migration, hybrid approaches, or simply understanding what's possible.

Would it be useful to compare notes? Happy to share what we're seeing across the sector.

## EMAIL 4: Klaus Thorup - ClearScore

**To:** klaus@clearscore.com  
**Subject:** Infrastructure that scales with ClearScore's growth

Hi Klaus,

ClearScore's growth trajectory is impressive - and fast-growing platforms often hit infrastructure inflection points where yesterday's choices become tomorrow's constraints.

With VMware licensing now unpredictable post-Broadcom, we're working with several UK fintechs exploring Nutanix for better economics and simpler scaling. The performance profile suits high-transaction platforms particularly well.

Worth a quick conversation to see if it's relevant to where ClearScore is heading?

## EMAIL 5: Marius van Tonder - ICBC Standard Bank

**To:** marius.vantonder@icbcstandard.com  
**Subject:** VMware alternatives for banking infrastructure

Hi Marius,

As Head of IT Infrastructure at ICBC Standard Bank, you're likely navigating the VMware licensing changes that are hitting banking particularly hard - where compliance and reliability can't be compromised regardless of vendor pricing decisions.

We're a Nutanix partner working with UK banks on migration assessments and hybrid strategies. For organisations your size, we're typically seeing 40-60% TCO improvements while maintaining enterprise-grade resilience.

Would 20 minutes be useful to explore whether this applies to your environment?

## EMAIL 6: Matt Rowe - AJ Bell

**To:** matt.rowe@ajbell.co.uk  
**Subject:** AJ Bell - infrastructure options post-VMware changes

Hi Matt,

As a FTSE 250 platform handling significant transaction volumes, AJ Bell's infrastructure choices directly impact both performance and bottom line.

The Broadcom/VMware situation is prompting many investment platforms to reassess. We're helping several explore Nutanix - same enterprise capabilities, predictable licensing, and strong performance for high-transaction workloads.

Would it be useful to share what we're seeing? Happy to keep it brief - 15 minutes to see if it's relevant.

## EMAIL 7: James Foster - Bridgepoint Group

**To:** james.foster@bridgepoint.eu  
**Subject:** Infrastructure efficiency for investment management

Hi James,

Private equity firms like Bridgepoint typically run lean but need enterprise-grade reliability - especially when infrastructure supports fund operations and sensitive deal data.

With VMware costs rising sharply post-Broadcom, we're working with several investment managers exploring Nutanix as an alternative. The simplified management model suits lean IT teams particularly well.

Worth a brief conversation to see if this is on your radar?

## EMAIL 8: Simon Bonner - British International Investment

**To:** sbonner@bii.co.uk  
**Subject:** Infrastructure planning at BII - VMware alternatives

Hi Simon,

Government-backed institutions like BII typically take a long-term view on infrastructure - which makes the current VMware pricing uncertainty particularly challenging to plan around.

We're a Nutanix partner helping UK financial services organisations assess alternatives. Nutanix offers predictable licensing, strong security posture, and the reliability that mission-critical operations require.

Would it be useful to discuss how this might fit BII's infrastructure strategy?

## EMAIL 9: Simon Binns-Hall - interactive investor

**To:** simon.binns-hall@ii.co.uk  
**Subject:** Infrastructure performance for high-volume platforms

Hi Simon,

Investment platforms like interactive investor live or die by infrastructure performance - slow page loads lose customers, and downtime during market volatility is unforgivable.

With VMware pricing now unpredictable, we're helping similar platforms explore Nutanix. The performance profile suits high-transaction environments, and the licensing model actually makes sense.

Worth 15 minutes to compare notes on what you're seeing?

## EMAIL 10: Robert Field - Hampshire Trust Bank

**To:** robert.field@htb.co.uk  
**Subject:** VMware alternatives for specialist banking

Hi Robert,

Specialist banks like Hampshire Trust often have infrastructure needs that don't fit the big-bank mould - but still require enterprise reliability and banking-grade compliance.

We're working with several UK banks navigating the VMware pricing changes, exploring Nutanix as an alternative. For mid-market banks, the economics and simplified management often make particular sense.

Would a brief call be useful to see if this is relevant to your environment?
