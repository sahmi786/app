## SUGGESTED OUTREACH

**Subject:** Quick question about your infrastructure strategy

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is growing fast in the [industry] space - congratulations on the momentum.

With Broadcom's changes to VMware licensing causing headaches for many, I'm curious: are you exploring alternatives, or planning to stay the course?

We've helped similar organisations reduce virtualisation costs by 30-40% while improving performance. Happy to share specifics if useful.

Worth a 15-min call?

Best,
[Your name]
